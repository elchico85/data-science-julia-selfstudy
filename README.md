# 🎯 Self-Study Plan: Data Science & OR with Julia

Welcome to my personal learning journey. I'm a full-time worker, parent of three (3rd child arriving August 2025), and student in Management Engineering. This repository documents my exploration of Data Science and Operations Research using Julia.

## 🔧 Tools I’m Using
- JuMP.jl for optimization
- DataFrames.jl for data handling
- MLJ.jl for machine learning
- Plots.jl for visualization

## 🗓️ Timeline
See [self-study plan](notes/) for my monthly roadmap.

## 📁 Projects
- 📦 `scheduling-coils`: optimize and visualize job assignments in a coils plant
- 📦 `downtime-analysis`: find patterns in simulated production halts
- 💡 `dream-challenge`: fun case study combining DS + OR + automation

## 📓 Notes
Weekly reflections, frustrations, and progress.
